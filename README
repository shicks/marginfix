DESCRIPTION
  Authors using LaTeX to typeset books with significant margin
  material often run into the problem of long notes running off the
  bottom of the page. A typical workaround is to insert \vshift
  commands by hand, but this is a tedious process that is invalidated
  when pagination changes. Another workaround is memoir's \sidebar
  function, but this can be unsatisfying for short textual notes, and
  standard marginpars cannot be mixed with sidebars. This package
  implements a solution to make marginpars "just work" by keeping a
  list of floating inserts and arranging them intelligently in the
  output routine.
